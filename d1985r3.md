# Introduction

We propose a universal template parameter. This would allow for a generic
`apply` and other higher-order template metafunctions, as well as certain
type traits.

# Change Log

## R2 -> R3

Added make_unique example.

Changed first example to use an int NTTP instead of a template template parameter
to make it easier to understand.

## R1 -> R2

Having found overwhelming support for the feature in EWGI, and a concern
about contra- and co-variance of the `template auto` parameters, we include
discussion of these topics in the paper, together with the decision and
comparison tables that underpin the decision.

The decision was to explore both and put it to a vote.

Added list of questions for EWGI.

## R0 -> R1

- Greatly expanded the number of examples based on feedback from the BSI panel.
- Clarified that we are proposing eager checking

# Motivation

## `apply`

Imagine trying to write the `apply` metafunction.

It works in C++20 if one only considers type template parameters:

```cpp
template <template <typename...> typename F, typename... Args>
using apply = F<Args...>;

template <typename X>
struct G { using type = X; };

static_assert(std::is_same<apply<G, int>, G<int>>{}); // OK
```

As soon as `F` tries to take any kind of NTTP (non-type template-parameter)
or a template _template-parameter_, `apply` becomes impossible to write; we
need to provide analogous parameter kinds for every possible combination of
parameters:

```cpp
template <int I> struct H {};
apply<H, 3>  // error, can't pass H as arg1 of apply, nor 3 as arg2.
```

While `apply` is very simple, a metafunction like `bind` or `curry` runs into
the same problems.

## `fwd`

A simpler example we should also use is `fwd`, which merely forwards its second
template argument to its first, without the attempt of being variadic:

```cpp
template <template <typename> typename F, typename arg>
using fwd = F<arg>;
```

# Proposed Solution

Introduce a way to specify a truly universal template parameter that can bind
to anything usable as a template argument.

There are two ways we can go about specifying this, depending on whether we want
to be mathematically correct, or less powerful, imprecise, but "easy" to use.
(See the co/contravariance discussion below).

## "Easy" version

We spell it `template auto`. The syntax is somewhat up for debate in this
version of the solution.

```cpp
template <template <template auto...> typename F, template auto... Args>
using apply = F<Args...>;

apply<G, int>; // OK, G<int>
apply<H, 3>;   // OK, H<3>
```

## "Mathematically Correct" version

We need to introduce both a an _anything_ parameter (which we'll spell
`template auto` as above), and a _wildcard_ parameter (which, given the work in
pattern matching, we are probably free to spell `__`).

We can then define `apply` as follows:

```cpp
template <template <__...> typename F, template auto... Args>
using apply = F<Args...>;
```

`fwd` is similar:

```cpp
template <template <__> typename F, temmplate auto arg>
using fwd = F<arg>;
```

In this mechanism, `__` really is an "unconstrained" pattern match, and does not
declare a parameter kind - it's illegal to declare a `template <__ x> struct foo
{};`, for instance.


### Template _template-parameter_ binding

We have to consider the two phases of class template (and template alias)
usage: parsing, and substitution.

Let's take `apply` again:

```cpp
template <template <__...> typename F, template auto... Args>
using apply = F<Args...>;
```

This *parses*, because `F` is *declared* as a class template parameter taking
a pack of `template auto`, while `Args` is being expanded into a place that
takes `template auto` parameters.

When we pass a metafunction such as `is_same` as `F`:

```cpp
using result = apply<std::is_same, int, 1>; // error
```

everything is known, so the compiler is free to check dependent expansions at
instantiation time.


## Mechanisms

This chapter describes how universal template parameters work. First the basic
specialization based mechanism is described, and then how the similarities to
dependent names can be exploited to increase the functionality, with several
levels of refinement.

### Specializing class templates on parameter kind

The new universal template parameter introduces similar generalizations as
the `auto` universal NTTP did; in order to make it possible to pattern-match
on the parameter, class templates need to be able to be specialized on the
kind of parameter as well:

```cpp
template <template auto> struct X;

template <typename T>
struct X<T> {
  // T is a type
  using type = T;
};

template <auto val>
struct X<val> {
    using type = decltype(val);
};

template <template <typename> F>
struct X<F> {
  // F is a unary metafunction
  template <typename T>
  using type = F<T>;
};

template<template auto U> user()
{
    using type = X<U>;  // Regardless of U's kind X <U> is a type.
}

```
This basic specification allows the utterance of a universal template
parameter only in:

- *template-parameter-list* as the declaration of such a parameter.
- *template-argument-list* as the usage of such a parameter. It can bind
  only to a template parameter declared `template auto`.

This allows building enough traits to connect the new feature to the rest of the
language with library facilities, and rounds out template parameters as just
another form of a compile-time parameter. However, it has the same kind of
limitations we saw before `if constexpr` was introduced: Function templates
often had to rely on helper structs to do simple things.


### Allowing unversal template parameters in code

To make this feature easier to use we also propose that universal template
parameters are usable in code. To make parsing possible we then have to
disambiguate universal template parameters according to dependent name rules.

Unfortunately always disambiguating as value prevents `using type =
X<U>;` above from working as expected. U would be automatically disambiguated as
a value at parse time and if it turns out not to be a value at instantiation
time this is an error.

We actually have a version of this problem already with overloaded template
functions and dependent names:

```cpp
template<typename T> int f() { return sizeof(T); }
template<auto V> int f() { return V; }

template<typename T> int caller()
{
    return f<??? T::name>();
}
```

Here the second f is called if T::name is a value, but if it is a type an
instantiation error is caused, rather than the first f being called.

With universal template parameters this problem will be more articulated,
especially when universal template parameters are forwarded directly as in:

```cpp
template<template auto U> int caller2()
{
    return f<U>();
}
```

This compiles with C++20 disambiguation rules but always tries to call the
second overload of f as U is always treated as a value, with the surprising result
that `caller2` can't be instantiated with a type even though f has an overload
for types.

### Explicit ambiguaton syntax

To avoid this issue an _ambiguation_ syntax which prevents the automatic
disambiguation can be introduced. The ambiguation syntax can be the same as used
for the declaration of a universal template parameter, just like for typename
and template. We can then use this to resolve the problem in `caller2`.

```cpp
template<template auto U> int caller2()
{
    return f<template auto U>();
}
```

Note however that the first formulation of `caller2` is still valid code, which
makes ambiguation error prone in addition to being tedious.

If this type of ambiguation is also allowed for dependent names it can be used
to resolve the `caller` problem above too. This extension would unify universal
template parameters and dependent names further.


#### Deferring kind checking to instantiation

To avoid having to ambiguate universal template parameters kind matching can be
deferred to instantiation time. The template argument is still parsed as a
constant-expression but if it consists of only a universal template parameter no
check against the kind the template argument will be bound to is done during
parsing. Such deferred checking is already required if the template is in itself
dependent.

Now universal template parameters work as we have reason to expect from them:

```cpp
template<typename auto U> int caller3()
{
    auto u = f<U>();        // Instantiates for values and types
    using type = X<U>;      // Instantiates for all kinds.

    // Can fail instantiation if argument kind is wrong.
    auto v = U;             // Parses U as a value.
    using t = U*;           // Parses U as a type thanks to "down with typename".

    // Error during parse
    U x;                    // Error: U is parsed as a value
    template<typename T> using tpl = U<T>;  // Error: U is parsed as a value.

    // Disambiguation useful outside of template argument:
    typename U x;
    template<typename T> using tpl = template U<T>;
    typename template U<int> i;  // Note: New double disambiguation
    template U<int> vi;          // Future: variable template bound to U
}
```

With this rule the original formulation of `caller2` works as intended: At parse
time the universal template parameter U is treated as a value, but as the
constant-expression has no further contents its kind is re-evaluated at
substitution time and the resulting kind is matched against the template
parameter kind.

There are two options regarding in which cases to do this re-evaluation. One is
to do it only if the template parameter bound to is universal in which case it
doesn't solve the issue with overloaded function templates taking different
template parameter kinds. The other option is to re-evaluate whenever the
template _argument_ is a constant-expression consisting of only a universal
template parameter. This handles the function overload case too.

The same rule can be extended to dependent names, which would resolve `caller`
without need for ambiguation. Note that no C++20 code is broken by this change
as `caller` is currently only callable when T::name resolves to a value.


#### Make use of known template parameter kinds

When parsing a template argument in a template argument list the expected kind
of the template argument is most often known from the template. This could be
exploited to reduce the disambiguation needed in template arguments:

```cpp
template<typename auto U> int caller4()
{
    std::vector<U*> v;
}
```

This would fail to parse using even deferred kind checking as `U*` is an invalid
expression. However, if the compiler was mandated to check that vector's first
template parameter is a typename it could correctly parse `U*` under the same
rule as a type alias can.

A drawback with this feature is that as some templates are dependent at parse
time this simplification can not always be employed. While this should be fairly
easy for programmers to see it is still one more rule to remember when thinking
about whether disambiguation is needed.

Due to this and as this possibility was a late discovery and opens up some
possible new risks we do not propose to extend the proposal in this way at this
time.


## Clarifying examples

### Single parameter examples

```cpp
template <int>                            struct takes_int {};
template <typename T>                     using  takes_type = T;
template <template auto>                  struct takes_anything {}
template <template <typename> typename F> struct takes_metafunc {};

template <template <template auto> typename F, template auto Arg>
struct fwd {
  using type = F<Arg>; // ok, passed to template auto parameter
}; // ok, correct definition

void f() {
  fwd<takes_int, 1>{};    // ok; type = takes_int<1>
  fwd<takes_int, int>{};  // error, takes_int<int> invalid
  fwd<takes_type, int>{}; // ok; type = takes_type<int>
  fwd<takes_anything, int>{}; // ok; type = takes_anything<int>
  fwd<takes_anything, 1>{};   // ok; type = takes_anything<1>
  fwd<takes_metafunc, takes_int>; // ok; type = takes_metafunc<takes_int>
  fwd<takes_metafunc, takes_metafunc>{}; // error (1)
}
```

(1): `takes_metafunc` is not a metafunction on a *type*, so
     `takes_metafunc<takes_metafunc>` is invalid (true as of *C++98*).

### Pack Expansion Example

It is interesting to think about what happens if one expands a
non-homogeneous pack of these. The result should not be surprising:

```cpp
template <template auto X, template auto Y>
struct is_same : std::false_type {};
template <template auto V>
struct is_same<V, V> : std::true_type {};

template <template auto V, template auto ... Args>
struct count : std::integral_constant<
    size_t,
    (is_same<V, Args>::value + ...)> {};

// ok, ints = 2:
constexpr size_t ints = count<int, 1, 2, int, is_same, int>::value;
```

### Example of parsing ambiguity (if late check)

The reason for eager checking is that not doing that could introduce parsing
ambiguities. Example courtesy of [@P0945R0], and adapted:

```cpp
template <template auto A>
struct X {
  void f() { A * a; }
};
```

The issue is that we do not know how to parse `f()`, since `A * a;` is either
a declaration or a multiplication.

If we treated `A` as just a dependent name, this always parses as a
multiplication.

Original example from [@P0945R0]:

```cpp
template <typename T> struct X {
  using A = T::something; // P0945R0 proposed universal alias
  void f() { A * a; }
};
```

# Example Applications

This feature is very much needed in very many places. This section lists
examples of usage.

## Enabling higher order metafunctions

This was the introductory example. Please refer to the [Proposed Solution].

Further example: `curry`:

```cpp
template <typename <template auto...> typename F,
          template auto ... Args1>
struct curry {
  template <template auto... Args2>
  using func = F<Args1..., Args2...>;
};
```

## Making dependent `static_assert(false)` work

Dependent static assert idea is described in [@P1936R0] and [@P1830R1]. In the
former the author writes:

> Another parallel paper [@P1830R1] that tries to solve this problem on the library level is
> submitted. Unfortunately, **it cannot fulfill all use-case since it is hard to impossible to
> support all combinations of template template-parameters in the dependent scope**.

The above papers are rendered superfluous with the introduction of this feature. Observe:

```cpp
// stdlib
template <bool value, template auto Args...>
inline constexpr bool dependent_bool = value;
template <template auto... Args>
inline constexpr bool dependent_false = dependent_bool<false, Args...>;

// user code
template <template <typename> typename Arg>
struct my_struct {
  // no type template parameter available to make a dependent context
  static_assert(dependent_false<Arg>, "forbidden specialization.");
};
```

## Checking whether a type is a specialization of a given template

Main discussion of feature in [@P2098R0] by Walter Brown and Bob Steagall.

When writing template libraries, it is useful to check whether a given type
is a specialization of a given template. When our templates mix types and
NTTPs, this trait is currently impossible to write in general. However, with
the universal template parameter, we can write a concept for that easily as
follows.

```cpp
// is_specialization_of
template <typename T, template <template auto...> typename Type>
inline constexpr bool is_specialization_impl = false;

template <template auto... Params, template <template auto...> typename Type>
inline constexpr bool is_specialization_impl<Type<Params...>, Type> = true;

template <typename T, template <template auto...> typename Type>
concept is_specialization_of = is_specialization_impl<T, Type>;
```

With the above  we are able to easily constrain various utilities taking class templates:

```cpp
template <auto N, auto D>
struct ratio {
  static constexpr decltype(N) n = N;
  static constexpr decltype(D) d = D;
};

template <is_specialization_of<ratio> R1, is_specialization_of<ratio> R2>
using ratio_mul = simplify<ratio<
    R1::n * R2::n,
    R1::d * R2::d
  >>;
```

or create named concepts for them:

```cpp
template <typename T>
concept is_ratio = is_specialization_of<ratio>;

template <is_ratio R1, is_ratio R2>
using ratio_mul = simplify<ratio<
    R1::n * R2::n,
    R1::d * R2::d
  >>;
```

This concept can then be easily used everywhere:

```cpp
template <is_specialization_of<std::vector> V>
void f(V& v) {
  // valid for any vector
}
```

## Universal alias as a library

While this paper does not try to relitigate Richard Smith's [@P0945R0], it
does provide a solution to aliasing anything as a library facility, without
running into the problem that [@P0945R0] ran into.

Observe:

```cpp
template <template auto Arg>
struct alias /* undefined on purpose */;

template <typename T>
struct alias<T> { using value = T; }

template <auto V>
struct alias<V> : std::integral_constant<decltype(V), V> {};

template <template <template auto...> typename Arg>
struct alias<Arg> {
  template <template auto... Args> using value = Arg<Args...>;
};
```

We can then use alias when we *know* what it holds:

```cpp
template <template auto Arg>
struct Z {
  using type = alias<Arg>;
  // existing rules work
  using value = typename type::value; // dependent
}; // ok, parses

Z<int> z1; // ok, decltype(z1)::value = int
Z<1> z; // error, alias<1>::value is not a type
```

## Bringing CTAD to make_unique (and make_shared etc,)

With the introduction of CTAD a discrepancy was created which favors using plain new instead of
make_unique as the latter needs the template arguments of a template class to be spelled out.

With universal template parameters we can add overloads to make_unique
which make CTAD work in these situations:

```cpp
auto a = std::tuple(1, true, 'a');       // ok
auto ap = new std::tuple(1, true, 'a');  // ok

// not ok in C++20.
auto up = std::make_unique<std::tuple>(1, true, 'a');   

int arr[] = {1, 2, 3};

auto s = std::span(arr);                 // ok
auto sp = new std::span(arr);            // ok

// not implementable in C++20 as span has a NTTP.
auto sup = std::make_unique<std::span>(arr);  

```

An overload to implement this would look something like:

```cpp
template<template<typename auto...> class C, typename... Ps> 
auto make_unique(Ps&&... ps)
{
    return unique_ptr<decltype(C(std::forward<Ps>(ps)...))>(new C(std::forward<Ps>(ps)...));
}
```

Note that the decltype is required as there is no deduction guide for plain pointers, this is however not a
problem specific to the universal template overload.


## Impacts on the specialization of class templates

Universal template arguments enable what appears like overloading of
class templates by specializing a unimplemented primary template
taking a pack of universal template parameters.

```cpp
template <template auto...> struct my_container;

template <typename T> struct my_container<T> {
    my_container(T* data, size_t count);
    // A basic implementation
};

template <typename T, typename A> struct my_container<T, A> {
    my_container(T* data, size_t count);
    my_container(T* data, size_t count, const A& alloc);
    // An implementation using an allocator A
};

template <typename T, size_t SZ> struct my_container<T, SZ> {
    my_container(T* data, size_t count);
    // An implementation with an internal storage of SZ bytes
};

template <typename T> my_container(T*, size_t) -> my_container<T>;
template <typename T, typename A> my_container(T*, size_t, const A&) -> my_container<T, A>;

```

As the primary template is not defined there is only a default
constructor implicit deduction guide. The explicit deduction guides
select the first specialization unless an allocator object is given in
which case the second specialization is selected. To select the third
specialization the template arguments must be explicitly given.

## Impact on the partial specialization of NTTP templates

It is a common pattern in C++ to use SFINAE to constrain template
parameter types:

```cpp
template <typename T, typename=void>
struct A;

template <template <typename> typename T, typename U>
struct A<T<U>,std::enable_if_t<std::is_integral_v<U>>>
{
    // Implementation for templates with integral parameter types
};

template <template <typename> typename T, typename U>
struct A<T<U>,std::enable_if_t<std::is_floating_point_v<U>>>
{
    // Implementation for templates with floating point parameter types
};

template <typename T>
struct X {};

A<X<int>> a; // Uses integral partial specialization
```

The covariant behavior of `template auto` allows a similar pattern
to be used for NTTPs.

```cpp
template <typename T, typename=void>
struct B;

template <template <template auto> typename T, auto U>
struct B<T<U>,std::enable_if_t<std::is_integral_v<decltype(U)>>>
{
    // Implementation for templates with integral parameter types
};

template <template <typename> typename T, auto U>
struct B<T<U>,std::enable_if_t<std::is_floating_point_v<decltype(U)>>>
{
    // Implementation for templates with floating point parameter types
};

template <int I>
struct Y {};

B<Y<5>> b; // Uses integral partial specialization
```

This pattern cannot currently be used with NTTPs as `auto` behaves
contravariantly:

```cpp
template <typename T, typename=void>
struct C;

template <template <auto> typename T, auto U>
struct C<T<U>,std::enable_if_t<std::is_integral_v<decltype(U)>>>
{};

template <int I>
struct Z1 {};

template <auto I>
struct Z2 {};

C<Z1<5>> c1; // Error: T does not match Z1
C<Z2<5>> c2; // Ok: NTTP can only be `auto`
```

With partial specialization, covariant behavior is desired. We rely on
SFINAE to check that `T` accepts `U` and wish to accept any type of template
which can take an integral NTTP in this example. `template auto` allows
such a pattern to work without modifying the behavior of `auto`.

## Impacts on the specialization of variable templates

Universal template parameters can be used to implement what appears
like overloading of variable templates. 

The problem of not being able to delete the base case then becomes
more pressing than currently as selecting the base case should trigger
an error, but will be selected when none of the specialziations
matches. This is solved by [@P2041R0], which is assumed in the example
below.

```cpp

// Metafunction to find a tuple element by a type predicate.
template <template <typename> typename Pred, size_t Pos, typename Tuple> 
constexpr size_t tuple_find() {
    if constexpr (Pos == tuple_size_v<Tuple>())
        return npos;
    else if constexpr (Pred<remove_cvref_t<tuple_element_t<Pos, Tuple>>>::value)
        return Pos;
    else
        return tuple_find<Pred, Pos + 1, Tuple>();
}
template <template <typename> typename Pred, typename Tuple> 
constexpr size_t tuple_find() { return tuple_find<Pred, 0, Tuple>(); }

// Helper to bind the first arguments of a provided template
template <template <template auto...> TPL, template auto... Bs> struct curry {
    template <template auto... Ts> using func = TPL<Bs..., Ts>;
};

// Unimplemented base case.
template <template auto... Ps>
constexpr size_t tuple_find_v = delete;

template <template <typename> typename Pred, typename Tuple>
constexpr size_t tuple_find_v<Pred, Tuple> = tuple_find<Pred, Tuple>();

template <template <typename> typename Pred, size_t Pos, typename Tuple>
constexpr size_t tuple_find_v<Pred, Pos, Tuple> = tuple_find<Pred, Pos, Tuple>();

// Convenience specialization for use with binary predicate
template <template <typename, typename> typename Pred, typename M, typename Tuple> 
constexpr size_t tuple_find_v<Pred, M, Tuple> = tuple_find_v<curry<Pred, M>::template func, Tuple>;

// Convenience specialization to match particular type.
template <typename T, typename Tuple>
constexpr size_t tuple_find_v<T, Tuple> = tuple_find_v<std::is_same, T, Tuple>;

```

This example contains a metafunction `tuple_find` to find a matching element
in a tuple based only on its type. Unfortunately it must be
implemented as a constexpr function in C++20 if we want it to be usable
with or without the start position (which would mimic the `std::find`
function in the value domain).

With universal template parameters we can specialize a template
variable `tuple_find_v` to regain the symmetry with current
tuple oriented metafunctions such as `tuple_size_v` and
`tuple_element_t`.

Given further overloads of the constexpr function `tuple_find` we could simplify
the variable template definition to:

```cpp
template <template auto... Ps> constexpr size_t tuple_find_v = tuple_find<Ps...>();
```

This relies on the power of universal template parameters in another
way, and has the same simplicity as the current variable templates and
type aliases of the standard library type traits.

To take the consistency a step further `tuple_find` could be implemented
as a class template with universal template parameters as shown in the
previous example instead of as the function it must be in C++20.


## Integration with reflection

The authors expect that code using reflection will have a need for this
facility. We should not reach for code-generation when templates will do, and
so being able to pattern-match on the result of the reflection expression
might be a very simple way of going from the consteval + injection world back
to template matching.

The examples in this section are pending discussion with reflection authors.

Importantly, the authors do not see how one could write `is_specialization_of`
with the current reflection facilities, because one would have no way to
pattern-match. This is, however, also pending discussion with the authors of
reflection.

## Library fundamentals II TS detection idiom

TODO. Concievably simplifies the implementation and makes it far more
general.

# Covariance and Contravariance

## As of C++20

Consider the two concepts:

```cpp
template <typename T> concept A = true;
// B subsumes A
template <typename T> concept B = A<T> && true;
```

::: cmptable

## Covariance
```cpp
auto returns_a() -> A;
auto returns_b() -> B;
auto f() {
    // OK, requirement less constrained than returned value
    A x = returns_b();
    // Error, requirement stricter than returned value
    B y = returns_a();
}
```

## Contravariance
```cpp
template <template <B> typename f>
using puts_b = void;
template <template <A> typename f>
using puts_a = void;
template <B> using takes_b = void;
template <A> using takes_a = void;
using x = puts_b<takes_a>; // ok
// Error, constraint mismatch (gcc)
// clang accepts (in error)
using w = puts_a<takes_b>;
```

:::

We are used to the covariant case, but the usage of contravariant cases is
not as common. The issue with `puts_a<takes_b>` is that `puts_a` requires a
metafunction with a _wider interface_ than one that just accepts `B`s.

We have seen that concept-constrained template parameters behave correctly -
covariantly on returns, contravariantly on parameters; but do other template
parts as well?


Let's just replace `A` with `auto` and `B` with `int`:

```cpp
template <template <int> typename f> using puts_int = void;
template <template <auto> typename f> using puts_auto = void;
template <int> using takes_int = void;
template <auto> using takes_auto = void;
using x = puts_int<takes_auto>; // OK
using w = puts_auto<takes_int>; // Error, but MSVC, GCC and clang all accept
```

TODO: Ask James Touton where in the standard this is made an error.

Function pointers do not convert in either co- or contravariant ways:

```cpp
struct X {}; struct Y : X {};
using f_of_x = void(*)(X&);
using f_of_y = void(*)(Y&);
// Error, no conversions between function pointers
f_of_y fy = static_cast<f_of_x>(nullptr);

using f_to_x = X&(*)();
using f_to_y = Y&(*)();
// Error, no conversions between function pointers
f_to_x xf = static_cast<f_to_y>(nullptr);
```

It does work for virtual function covariant return types:

```cpp
struct ZZ {};
struct Z : ZZ {
   virtual auto f() -> Z&;
   virtual void g(Z&);
};
struct W : Z {
   auto f() -> W& override; // OK, covariant return type
   // Error, no contravariant parameter types
   void g(ZZ&) override;
};
```

How about parameter packs?

```cpp
template <template <typename> typename f> using puts_one = void;
template <template <typename...> typename f> using puts_var = void;
template <typename> using takes_one = void;
template <typename...> using takes_var = void;
using x = puts_one<takes_var>; // OK in 17 and 20, Error in 14
using w = puts_var<takes_one>; // OK, compiles
```

Turns out parameter packs behave both ways (but also covariantly) - not what
one would expect given the concepts example above.

## Design space exploration for `template auto`

We have inconsistent behavior across the language. Let's say we did the right
thing and made `template auto` behave contravariantly, like concepts.

```cpp
template <template <auto> typename f> using puts_value = void;
template <template <template auto> typename f> using puts_any = void;
template <auto> using takes_value = void;
template <template auto> using takes_any = void;
using x = puts_value<takes_any>; // OK
using w = puts_any<takes_value>; // Error because contravariant.
```

But then, how do we write `apply`? Let's do it for a single argument to avoid
complications with a covariant `...`:

```cpp
template <template <template auto T> typename f, template auto arg>
using apply1 = f<arg>;
```

The above is correct, but _useless_ - it requires `f`s signature to be
`template <template auto T>`. What we want to express is that `f` is
any kind of unary template metafunction, so we can pass in something like
`template <int x> using int_constant = std::integral_constant<int, x>;`.

As a thought experiment, let's call the covariant version of `template auto`
(with the meaning "deduce this from the argument") `__`:

```cpp
template <template <__ T> typename f, template auto arg>
using apply1 = f<arg>;
```

This is what we want to express (and check at instantiation time), but now
the `arg`s constraint is spelled differently from `f`'s constraint, and that
might be very, very difficult to teach.

It also requires us to reserve an additional combination of tokens. Contrast
what happens if we just made `template auto` behave covariantly (the way
`__` behaves above) if used in that position. What do we lose?

At first glance, we lose the ability to define the contravariant meaning of
`template auto` - a template parameter that *can* bind to anything. But can
we get that back?

Recall that concepts behave contravariantly. Consider this one:

```cpp
namespace std {
  template <template auto arg>
  concept anything = true;
};
```

If we relaxed the rule that only type concepts could appear in the template
parameter list, we could say this:

```cpp
template <template <std::anything ARG> typename takes_anything,
          template auto arg>
using apply1 = takes_anything<arg>;
```

This relaxation is *unlikely to happen* (given the past oral arguments in EWG),
but we can still constrain with `requires`, albeit that is a far
inferior-looking strategy.

This would behave *contravariantly*! While `template auto ARG` means "deduce",
a metafunction taking a concept (which behaves contravariantly!) that *anything*
satisfies *has* to be a metafunction taking `template auto` (or `std::anything`).

In light of this, the paper authors have come to the conclusion that trying
to make `template auto` behave contravariantly is all downside and little
upside. The example to follow with `template auto` should be the behavior of
`...` (deduction behavior, both co- and contravariant).

This allows for usage to look the same as declaration, and like to bind to
like. We anticipate the feature being much easier to teach this way, and in
the rare cases when someone really needs the contravariant behavior, they
will know to use a library-provided concept. It is also consistent with the
rest of the non-concept template language.

Of course, the library-concept solution requires an additional relaxation of
constraints syntax, but at least it's feasible in the future, as opposed to
requiring a second difficult-to-teach token sequence.

# Other Considered Syntaxes

In addition to the syntax presented in the paper, we have considered the
following syntax options:

## `.` and `...` instead of `template auto` and `template auto ...`

```cpp
template <template <...> typename F, . x, . y, . z>
using apply3 = F<x, y, z>;
```

The reason we discarded this one is that it is very terse for something that
should not be commonly used, and as such uses up valuable real-estate.

# Compendium: Open Design Questions

See discussions above to inform these choices; this section just compiles the
design questions for EWG and EWGI.

## Eager or Late Checking

Whether to:

- specify **eager** checking with conservative rules on use of identifiers, or;
- specify **late** checking on instantiation and use the C++20
  rules for parsing dependent expressions for them.

## Easy or Correct

Whether to:

- (**correct**) reserve *two* token sequences (`template auto` and `__`) and have a
  single defined meaning for both, or;
- (**easy**) reserve *one* token sequence (`template auto`) and switch its
  meaning in a context-dependent manner, losing the ability to mean
  `template auto` in a _template template-parameter_, since in that context,
  `template auto` would mean `__`.

# Further work (for context and planning): Cohesive template parameter theory

This work in **not a part of the proposal**, but we mention it here because this
paper falls into the wider framework of cleaning up template parameter theory.

This section is basically wholy thought up by James Touton. We thank him for his
ideas.

The core of the problem is that `...` behaves in a context-dependent manner; the
"easy" way, as outlined above.

We fundamentally have the following list of template parameter constraints
(ignoring concepts - those merely further constrain these atomic kinds):

- atomic constraints (may introduce identifiers, read "accepts" before the
  bullet):
  - anything: `template auto`
  - type: `typename T`
  - value, type-unconstrained: `auto V`
  - value, type-constrained: `int I`
  - metafunction-of: `template <parameter-constraints> typename F`
  - any-number-of _constraint_: `constraint...`
- metafunction parameter constraints:
  - atomic constraints (accepts _atomic constraint_):
    ```cpp
    template <template <auto...> typename F> struct f {
       // the 'auto' part: F accepts any value
       F<1>    x;      // instantiated with an int
       F<true> y;      // and also a bool
       // the '...' part: F handls any arity
       F<true, 1ll> z; // and also a bool and a 1ll
       F<> w;          // and also without params
       static_assert(!std::is_same_v<decltype(x), decltype(y)>);
    };
    ```
  - constraint relaxation (means "no constraint in this direction"):
    - "no constraint on arity": C++20 `...`
    ```cpp
    template <template <int ...> typename F, int ... Args>
    using apply_ints = F<Args...>;
    apply_ints<f, 1>; // works
    template <int x> square : std::integral_constant<int, x*x> {};
    apply_ints<square, 2>; // also works
    ```
    - "no constraint on kind": covariant `template auto` or `__`
    - "no constraint on type": covariant `auto`, no proposed spelling yet

We need some way to disambiguate the `...` case to be correct.
